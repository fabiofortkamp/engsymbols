engsymbols
==========

This is a LaTeX package to facilitate writing of documents containing many engineering symbols and notations in a concise manner. For example, the divergent of a vector x could be writen as `$\divergent{x}$`, instead of `$\nabla \vec{x}$`.

The main features of engsymbols are:

1. Like said avobe, definition of common shortcuts for operations
2. Definition of new units (for the [siunitx](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) package) that are common enough in engineering: mass per unit volume (kg/m^3), molar mass (kg/kmol) etc
3. Definition of dimensionless numbers such as Reynolds, Nusselt etc
